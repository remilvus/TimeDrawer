# TimeVisualiser
It's an app that visualises time based on a `.csv` file. The file must be in a format of [aTimeLogger](http://www.atimelogger.com/) `.csv` report.
![example](https://github.com/remilvus/TimeVisualiser/blob/master/example_result_no_legend.jpg)  

# Loading data
Click `load` button and select a .cvs report generated by aTimeLogger.

# Changing date range
By selecting dates "From" and "To" it's possible to use only part of the data.

# Grouping
Activities can be bundled in groups: 
- Select master activity (the group will have it's name)
- Select all sub-activities

# Colors
Color assigned to each activity is random, but it's also possible to choose color for each activity.

# Saving the result
Resulting visualisation can be saved (with or without legend).

# A standalone version is available [here] (no Python required)(https://github.com/remilvus/TimeVisualiserStandalone)
